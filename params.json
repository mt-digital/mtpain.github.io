{"name":"In the mind of M T-Pain","tagline":"Dear whoever,","body":"## Welcome\r\nHello, world. Welcome to my github.io page. It will be awesome, soon, I promise.\r\n\r\n### Interests\r\nAt work, we use [D](www.dlang.org) for all our data processing.  Throughout grad school and undergrad, most of my projects used [python](www.python.org). Recently, I've been using python for prototyping new stuff, especially graphs with [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/). Visualization has always been a passion for me, so I've been exploring [d3](http://d3js.org/). \r\n\r\nMy favorite magazine is [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/), but I'm more of a hippie/radical/free thinker than some expect on first glance.  One project I'll soon include here is my efforts at understanding the military-industrial-academic complex and the vast network of government contracts in general.  \r\n\r\nMy girl and I have a beautiful garden. It's a beautiful, heartwarming thing to cook up a meal full of stuff we grew ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhen I grow up I want to be a full-stack engineer at a stellar news organization like [Democracy Now!](democracynow.org). \r\n\r\n### About Me\r\nI was born in Rochester, NY, spent four years getting a master's in applied physics at Rice University in Houston.  Currently I'm a data engineer living in Moscow, ID.  I have three cats, Muffin, Lupe, and Giorno. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
