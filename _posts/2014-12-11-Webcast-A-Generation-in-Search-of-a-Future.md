See the previous post for more on George Wald, his speech, and some of my 
thoughts on his momentous act of resistance. He was a genius, Nobel
Prize-winning biologist, and a man with the light. 

# Poem

<p style="text-align:center">
In my days as a scientist fed of dreams of mental bliss <br>
exploring open questions I learned this life lesson <br>
that there is a machine that feeds you dreams; <br>
behind the scenes they got assistants  <br>
for their magic act, they reach into their magic hat <br>
and pull out a stack of dollars. <br>
If you play along you get influence, fame, money, power, <br>
be the accomplice to the crimes that the devil had on <br>
since the beginning of time.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
I was instructed by a scientist at Lockheed, they got big during the last <br>
War to end all Wars, disaster capitalist, tellin me they gotta see this  <br>
on the front of a warhead <br>
if you support war, then you support more dead. <br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
Defense Department takes the money puts it towards <br>
nobody knows what and we don't know how much, no we don't know how much. <br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
Invest in the highest risk, 1% success rate projects,  <br>
and none of the profit will come to us, no none of the profit will come to us,
<br>
but still the prophets will come to us, yes still the prophets will come to us
<br><br>

They keep the profits <br>
They hold the prophets <br>
They keep the profits <br>
enslaved the prophets  <br>
They keep the profits <br>
They killed the prophets <br>
They keep the profits <br>
</p>
