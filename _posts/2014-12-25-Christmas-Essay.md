# Intro

I went to a church service away from my regular church since I'm visiting family
for the holidays. I was struck and disappointed that the sermon was so secular.
So it's only fitting that this Christmas essay should center around a secular
book, Steinbeck's _East of Eden_. The part of it I want to discuss is not
secular, but some of the books characters might argue that it is not religious
either. This part is the book's discussion of the story of Cain and Abel,
which serves as the center of gravity for the entire book, appearing in 
different scaffolded guises.

The biblical events that happen "east of Eden" carry a lesson that's reinforced
by Jesus himself: this is, God has provided a means for us to achieve peace and
happiness. The road to these may not be easy, in fact it may be steep and
narrow. But the reward is the Kingdom of Heaven.

Though walking the path may be difficult at times, the directions for staying
on it are simple: Love the Lord with all your Strength, Spirit, Mind, and Heart.
The auxiliary command is to love your neighbor as God has loved you. On these
instructions lie all of God's Law and the Prophets.

The Good News that's delivered by Jesus and rediscovered by the characters of
_East of Eden_ and in the Bible East of the Garden of Eden is that salvation is
a choice we humans make. At any point we may repent and regain the Light of the
Lord. To seal the deal, though, we must forgive those who ask us for it 7x77
times. To do so is to live righteously. Here also the road narrows and inclines.
With the gifts we inherit from being of Man, walking this road is impossible;
with God, nothing is.


# Timshel!

I think Steinbeck's meditations on the meaning of the story of Cain and Abel 
speak for themselves, but here is a brief background of the three characters
involved in the discussion. 

There is Samuel Hamilton, who came to the Salinas Valley in search of fortune
and, in a way, found it. He is a dirt farmer, but he is also a philosopher and
inventor. He never managed to make money off his farm or inventions, but he was
well loved by everyone he touched.

At the time of the discussion, Samuel had just punched the second character of
note, Adam Trask. Adam has two sons, Aron and Caleb, and a brother Charles. The
sons are fraternal twins, and likely one of them is not actually Adam's, but 
instead Charles'. Their mother is somewhat of a sociopath who shot Adam and
lives in Salinas as a prostitute/matron of a whorehouse there. With Samuel's
punch in the face, which was very difficult for Samuel, Adam is just beginning
to recover his wits after his wife left him.

Third and finally, there is Lee, Adam's Chinese servant. He is also a
philosopher like Samuel. Lee raises Aron and Caleb, and does it better than Adam
ever could.

## Thou mayest

Samuel has come to meet Adam and convince him to finally name his boys; Samuel
punches Adam to smack some sense into him. After that, Lee asks Samuel, “Do you
remember when you read us the sixteen verses of the fourth chapter of Genesis
and we argued about them?” Samuel does remember. They had had an argument about
it, specifically the ambiguous translation that results in conflicting verbage
between the King James Version (KJV) and the American Standard Version (ASV) of
English translations in those verses, which are the story of Cain and Abel.

The two versions agree acceptably until Jehova speaks these words to Cain:

### King James Version

> Jehova says, 'If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou
> doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto these shall be his desire, and
> *thou shalt* rule over him.'

This is a promise from God: Cain _shall_ rule over sin.

### American Standard Version

> Jehova says, 'If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou
> doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto these shall be his desire, and
> *do thou* rule over him.'

Lee observes, "This is not a promise, it is an order."

How can this ambiguity be resolved? Lee holds on to this in his mind. Lee is a
"critic of truth," and as such he brings this issue to learned old Chinese men
in San Francisco to get their opinion. They are also puzzled, and turn to the
original ancient Hebrew version. To complete this difficult task of translation,
the learned men and Lee study and argue with learned Rabbis, everyone deeply
concerned with discerning the truth. If they share a faith in anything, this
unlikely group of men share faith in Truth. 

The Hebrew word that has been ambiguously translated is "timshel." The scholars
finally settle that this word is properly translated "thou mayest." I share 
Lee's excitement about this discovery. This frees Man from predefined fate. 
Lee says, 

> Why, that makes a man great, that gives him stature with the gods, for in his
> weakness and his filth and his murder of his brother he has still the great
> choice. He can choose his course and fight it through and win.” Lee’s voice
> was a chant of triumph. 


## God is still speaking

These days I hear God's call. He is calling me to, first and foremost, be
honest, straightforward, and loving to myself, which means not wallowing in
self-pity or self-sorrow. Because as Jesus teaches us, "Before you go to pick
the speck out of your friend's eye, first remove the splinter out of your own
eye!" Secondly, he is telling me to tell the truth I've lived and studied, to
speak out on the evil of our times, to point out waste, Creation-killing,
hypocrisy, and greed and fearmongering that keep the oligarchy powerful and
unimaginably wealthy. I should speak up and care for the destitute within
American communities and for those on the receiving end of our
military-industrial complex-driven, imperialist war machine. Some in this
country live like kings on islands of wealth while poor, mad, hungry, dying 
souls tread water in the vast ocean of American poverty.

I imagine ways to fight this worrying trend: build a public relations machine
that will win minds by emanating truth. A web app that is a hub for all sorts of
data, much like [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/) or [Taxpayers for
Common Sense](http://www.taxpayer.net/), perhaps using their data or
supplementing their data. I need to get involved in these and other ongoing
government accountability projects. I need to do my own "civic hacking". 

But sometimes the cowardice sets in. I want to go back to _East of Eden_,
because I found the philosophy important to these sorts of ideas. 

In Chapter 22 on page 589, Samuel says, "The man I'm named for had his name
called by the Lord God, and I've been listening all my life. And once or twice
I've thought I heard my name called--but not clear, not clear." Continuing, he
explains why he's a dirt farmer: "I might have called (God's) name--but I did
not. There you have the difference between greatness and mediocrity...It's nice
for a mediocre man to know greatness must be the loneliest state in the world."
A final quote from Samuel on courage: "It takes great courage to back truth
unacceptable to our times. There's a punishment for it, and it's usually
crucifixion."

It's the crucifixion that scares me, and the loneliness. The cowardice sounds
like, "It will be difficult and I may get rejected if I try to, say, advertise
what I've been doing on Facebook or Twitter or elsewhere." Or, "too much
political talk makes me weary and depressed." I fear losing comforts of home, my
cats, then begin to excuse myself from any sort of duty because I'm not good
enough anyway or I don't know enough, didn't go to the best schools, and so on.
Like Samuel describes his son, Tom, who Samuel feels could be "great",

> He climbed ecstatic mountains and floundered in the rocky darkness between the
> peaks. He had spurts of bravery but they were bracketed in by cowardice.

The story of Cain and Abel, properly interpreteted, is a triumphant story
because "thou mayest". It's logically pleasing because it's converse, "thou
mayest not" is also true. But more importantly, it frees mankind from the fate
of being inherently violent and thus inherently doomed. That means that it's up
to all of us to choose how we live. It frees me from despair because working
towards a more peaceful world is no longer a naive, childish dream, but a holy
directive. Greatness is a choice just as goodness is.

I am a Christian because, despite being called to lay down his life, Jesus cares
for the sick and poor, performing miracles that seem impossible, while
simultaneously exposing the hypocrisy of the chief priests and attendants of his
time. His bravery and unwavering ability to serve God is an inspiration to me.
His wisdom is timeless, which means it is God's wisdom. "Blessed are the poor in
spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven." This does not mean that in order
to have God's blessing, we are to humble ourselves to the point of feeling
worthless. Instead, when we are poor in spirit, we realize that our spirit is
fed from God; we turn to him and in turn inherit the Spirit, which is the same
as the Kingdom. Though at times my courage may falter, I pray for His courage so
that mine may not.

# Closing thoughts

God, to me, is a lot of things, Creator of and in  everything. God is the
unexpected words of a friend when you go to that friend hurt, and come away
healed in a surprising way. God is our mothers and fathers, sisters, brothers,
aunts, uncles, cousins--God is everywhere. God is you. God is me.

Then, "how you treat the least among you is how you treated me," Jesus says.
This following verse is a cornerstone of my spirituality and Christianity, and
in its way supports the belief that "thou mayest" choose because we've been
given that gift from God. I quote the entire passage here as a final meditation

### John 10:31-39 (New International Version)

> Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus said to
> them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do
> you stone me?"
>
> "We are not stoning you for any good work," they replied, "but for blasphemy,
> because you, a mere man, claim to be God."
>
> Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your law 'I have said you are
> gods'? If he called them 'gods', to whom the word of God came--and scripture
> cannot be set aside--what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very
> own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I
> said, "I am God's son"? Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father.
> But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that
> you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father."
> Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp.
