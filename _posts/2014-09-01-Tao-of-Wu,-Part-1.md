> [--RZA, "The Birth"](http://grooveshark.com/s/The+Birth/3VHI6z?src=5)

I already had a lot of respect for RZA, his rhymes, his music, and his spirituality before I read his book, "The Tao of Wu". 
After reading his book, his lyrics take on a new depth and shine. He taught me the geology of the source ofh is jewels: part of
it was high stress and pressure: getting
choked out for thirty-five cents in the projects when he was eight, living with 18 people in a crowded project apartment,
watching human feces roll past his basement window when the streets flooded, and facing an attempted murder trial in 
Stubenville, Ohio. But, as my pastor says, God was always alongside him, talking to him through a junkie saying, "The 
Gods are correct"; his cousin Gary, the GZA, one of RZA's first teachers, and finally the murder trial and his mother saying: 
This is your chance, time to get your act together. After that RZA meditates hard, walking around Staten Island and talking to
God. 

## Enumerating righteousness: the twelve jewels, the eightfold path, and the ultimate law

RZA enumerates the twelve jewels, which are much like the eightfold path, which in turn are like teachings of Jesus. 
Between the twelve jewels and Jesus's teachings, the main point is that first you should clothe yourself in the holy
spirit, seek ye first the kingdom of God, and God will not only teach you what to say, but you will be clothed in
righteousness. You will have no need for fancy clothes since God has provided for you generously. You will not need
to worry about what you will eat: Does God not care for each numbered sparrow? God has counted each hair on your head,
so you are worth more than a sparrow, and yet he provides food for all. Yes, we should give thanks for the physical food
that sustains our physical bodies, but when we ask God to "Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts
as we forgive our debtors" we are really asking God for the strength to seek forgiveness and redemption and be ready
to forgive those who have done us wrong: this is the law from which all other laws of righteousness flow: love your
neighbor as God loves you. 

### The twelve jewels

This ultimate law is easy to digest and say, "yes!", but practicing that is difficult. Here are the twelve jewels:

1. Knowledge
2. Wisdom
3. Understanding

4. Freedom
5. Justice
6. Equality

7. Food
8. Clothing
9. Shelter

10. Love
11. Peace
12. Happiness

To explain these, I'll quote directly from *The Tao of Wu*

> First a man gets Knowledge, which is knowledge of self. Then he gets wisdom, which is the reflection of that knowledge. 
> Then he gets Understanding, which is the power to act on Wisdom. With Understanding he sees that he has Freedom---that he has
> *freed* his *dome* from ignorance---which means he has free will. But Freedom operates under a law: the law of Justice. That 
> means I'm free to smack you in your face, but justice applies: There will be a reward or a penalty for my actions. Therefore,
> I must deal with Equality, because all men are created equal. By showing Equality to one another we're activating Freedom,
> Justice, and Equality---the fourth-through-sixth jewels. <br> <br>
> Now, those are all things that build a man's character. And after you attain them, you're able to strive for Food, Clothing, and Shelter---which
> also have both physical and mental meanings. Obviously, food is nourishment, shelter is a home, and clothing is protection.
> But *mental* food is food from the tree of life---wisdom, science, history, food for your mind. *Mental* clothing is how you carry yourself---
> the way you walk, the way you move and speak. If you have clothed yourself in righteousness, even the bummiest clothing has dignity.
> And *mental* shelter is the mind's protection from the evil atmosphere---the lies and corruption of the outside world. So if you have these three jewels,
> your home is like a king's even if you're living in a shack.


### (4+8=12): the eightfold path and the four noble truths 

#### The Four Noble Truths


1. The Noble Truth of Suffering: identification of the facts of life that directly correspond to suffering
2. The Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering: suffering is caused by craving through a twelve-step, infinite cycle 
3. The Noble Truth of the Extinction of Suffering: extinction of suffering is obtained by making cravings vanish in an enlightened state
4. The Noble Truth of the Noble Eightfold Path: the steps to take to become enlightened and break the cycle of craving



#### The Noble Eightfold Path



1. Right Understanding
2. Right Mindedness
3. Right Speech
4. Right Action
5. Right Living
6. Right Effort
7. Right Attentiveness
8. Right Concentration


The Twelve Jewels, as well as the Supreme Mathematics, the Supreme Alphabet, and the other teachings of the Five Percent Nation, are 
all derived from teachings of Islam. I have heard that Islam means to submit and that a Muslim is one who submits, but RZA
translates Islam as "peace". It is, or should be, easy for a Christian to understand how these could translate to be the same
thing. In Christian thought, when one submits his life to following Jesus, which means loving others as God loves him, then comes peace.
When communities choose to do this, then peace spreads. Part of why Christian teaching is, or should be, so irresistible: everyone deserves love,
so give love. But where Christianity falls short is a failure to accept and freely admit that, yes, we are all hypocrites and Christians seem 
to lose sight of the fact that we are Christians precisely because we need help to be good. 

Yet for me, the Bible isn't enough: I need more than parables to guide my thinking. The parables gain even more importance and power when I 
do the knowledge, understand the mechanics of the parables. RZA helped me understand this through his story of meeting GZA who told him about God,
that God was actually inside RZA. On the way home, RZA was given a pamphlet called "The Bread of Life." RZA read that, and the entire Bible after, and
he says "I'd heard Bible stories my whole life...This time I understood how to read the Bible, how to look at it for what's real 
in my heart instead of what somebody's telling me."

It seems daunting to answer the question, "How do I go from being a hopeless sinner to following Jesus?" For those of us who
did not live in Jesus's time, it seems overwhelming to take just what He said and transform our lives. But, just as the twelve jewels, the 
mathematics, the Alphabet, the Eightfold Path and the Four Noble Truths were meant to do, they break down the imperative into steps and principles
so that the difficult demands of Christianity are more attainable. It's the difference between climbing a mountain by cutting through the lower brush and going
straight up the first route one finds to climbing the mountain using a trail that wise people of history have helped break. 

## RZA the scientist

One of the purposes of 120 Lessons was to give black youth a sense of their place in the World and the Universe. Some of these things 
were just facts about the Earth, like, "The diameter of the Earth is 7,926 miles," "The circumference of the planet Earth is approximately 25,000 miles," 
"The Earth has only 57,255,000 square miles of land on it. And out of that, only 29 million is useful," and many more. I agree when he says knowing this 
"kind of information grounds you, shrinks your problems and expands your horizons at the same time." Wow.

It's not clear whether through the lessons or through other 
study, but one of the most important points he makes that weaves well with Christian teachings, as RZA himself points out, is that light just goes. Light is energy, light 
is not influenced by the passage of time, the foundational fact of the special theory of relativity. From the first five verses of the first chapter of the Book of John, 

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the 
> beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
> In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
> And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. 

The light resurrects. The light is immortal. Light enters us and exits us, light created all life on earth and when the physical light from the Sun is 
extinguished, life as we know it must end. Light uses the second law of thermodynamics so that the excess energy goes into creating things that seem like they are
antithetical to the second law of thermodynamics, which as RZA notes in his *Tao*, says that all things in the Universe tend toward greater and greater 
chaos, mixing, or in physial terms, higher entropy. God, through the light of the Sun (through the light of the Son), brought life 
into being, seemingly antithetical to this Second Law, but actually in accordance with it by the excess of Light God provided.

## Final blessing

This is the first of probably many posts inpsired by RZA's "The Tao of Wu". To close this reflection on that piece and the wider 
teachings RZA's *Tao* transmits, there is one fundamental piece of wisdom to remember: It takes a person many times to hear the
voice of God and be ready to respond. His cousins Daddy-O and GZA taught him ways to find God through the lessons and the twelve jewels. 
But it wasn't until RZA, who had for a year "stopped believing out of anger" with his brother, was visited by an angel in the form of
a "nappy headed junkie". His grandmother offered the junkie a hot dog, and the junkie said "There better not be any pork in it." 

> When I heard him say that---just mumbling in a kind of daze---it spoke to me. Then he looked at me and said, 
> "The Lessons are right; the Gods are right." When he finished talking he got up and left, and my heart opened again.

RZA recounts that it took three calls from an angel saying to Muhammad, "Read!", and Muhammad complaining that he was illiterate
before Muhammad began to read. In the Bible, Peter denies Jesus three times before the cock crowed and Peter wept bitterly,
even though Jesus told him, "You will deny me, Peter". In Acts, Peter again says "not so!" three times to God, Himself, when God tells
Peter that the Word is not for Jews only, but for the whole World. However, when Peter finally relays this Good News to the other
disciples, it is a cause for great celebration.

So, to end with a prayer, 

Creator,

May we go out with open ears and ready to hear, but may we not be saddened or disheartened when we humans make mistakes.
May we confess our shortcomings and keep an open heart, knowing that through knowledge, understanding, wisdom, and right effort,
we can live like kings, clothed in righteousness and fed on the Holy Spirit. May we love others as you love us, and forgive those
who wrong us just as you have loved us. The way we treat the least among us is the way we treat you. May we remember the Law of 
Justice as we walk through Creation.

All praise due to God.

Amen. Peace.
