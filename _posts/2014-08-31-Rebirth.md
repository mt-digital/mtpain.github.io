# The news

Todd Snider tells a good story on a track titled [The News was Good](http://grooveshark.com/s/The+News+Was+Good/3U7Qf4?src=5) from 
what grooveshark says is a bootleg. Mr. Snider is one of my favorite artists. Anyway, today, I'm sure that the news is good.

I went to church. I have been reading RZA. Yet I got depressed. I think about mental health a lot, and I know that I'd been 
very high manic, insatiable for knowledge and wisdom, and yet every time I think I've attained a new level of understanding,
that the understanding won't die, then I fall back to death.

So, this blog and other outlets like uploading my music on Soundcloud will, I imagine, help me define my edges. This happens when we meet
others, when we see or hear our voice in media. I don't know a medium other than a web page where I can put pod casts, essays, songs,
book reviews all in one place and see them in chronological order.

So, all praise due to God, this is hopefully the first of many. A new rebirth for Rebirth Galaxy.
