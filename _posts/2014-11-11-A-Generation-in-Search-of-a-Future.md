# Introduction and outline

George Wald was a Harvard Professor who won the Nobel Prize for his work on 
human color vision. As revealed in this teach-in, he was also a critic of the
Vietnam War and the historical pattern of war, capitalization and preoccupation
with death and destruction, and the purchasing of everything from labor unions
to science itself by the Department of Defense. Wald notes that when all 
wars are wars of defense, then anything goes. 

As the LP record version of the liner notes describe,
"The Wald speech was part of an important event—a strike by 
scientists at M.I.T., the largest academic defense contractor." 
I have never heard or read anyone so eloquently and completely outline the 
threat that our governments obsession with "defense" actually poses. He 
soars from describing an unspeakable melancholy among students that has something to do with
the Vietnam War. But it goes deeper than that: Wald perceives that 
"it’s as if there’s a widespread feeling that learning has become irrelevant." 

Through examples including of the corruption of science by government money, the haughty
and merciless attitude of military leaders, and the prevailing apocalyptic
calculations that pass for truth for a Harvard faculty member in political 
science, Wald argues that the melancholy felt by the generation of students he 
lectures stems from a future which may not be worth living through. As he says,
even with victory in nuclear war, the world that would follow would not be
worth all the fighting. Yet in all aspects of life, students who care feel 
powerless. They are mocked: It's not that the students who are protesting 
are revealing legitimate injustice and criminality, no. Instead, the 
universities have a "student problem".

# Where we hide our treasure

In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says, "Look where a man hides his treasure, 
for there his heart will be also." Furthermore, "A man cannot serve two masters.
Either he will despise the one and love the other, or he will be faithful to 
one and curse the other. You cannot serve God and wealth." Wald pleads with us
to consider the consequences of keeping a giant army and building up army-trained 
and equipped police forces. He notes that such a large army will always find
something to do and that we can expect more holocausts, either abroad or at home.

As Jesus says, when we put hundreds of billions of dollars _every year_ towards
killing, destruction, and subterfuge, we show where our heart lies. The DoD 
money machine seduces scientists, labor unions, democrats, republicans, 
everyone. In this way, those who choose to engage in the business of death are
choosing to serve this machine, or industrial-military-academic-and-so-on 
complex. In doing so we are darkening the light of our eyes, we are killing the
world around us.

Wald tells the story concerning the 
[battle of Khe Sahn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Khe_Sanh)
of the Vietnam War which took place between January 21 and July 9, 1968. A 
Marine base became isolated, surrounded by two to three divisions of the North
Vietnamese Army. In an attempt to ease the pressure, over 100,000 tons of bombs,
as Wald says, "more explosives than fell on Japan throughout World War II and 
more than fell on the whole of Europe during the years 1942 and 1943." Remarking
about the results of the bombardment, an American officer said, "It looks like
the world caught smallpox and died"

# Apocalpyse Now

According to a Harvard professor of government, the risk "if nothing changes"
is 2% a year for full-scale nuclear war. Wald notes that extrapolating those
chances forward in time puts the risk of nuclear war happening by the year 2000
at 50%! 

Military planners at the time include game-theoretic simulations of nuclear
war in which 50 million Americans are killed in a nuclear attack. 
Wald notes that the common perception of this fact at the time is something like
you wake up and read in the paper that 50 million people had died, you think
it's terrible, but you could continue going about your life. But he reminds us
that even though 200,000 people died immediately following the nuclear attacks
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, another 200,000 were maimed, burned, and tortured,
and even more were sickened. So if 50 million were killed, then a great many
millions, maybe 150 million or more, would be poisoned, injured, or dying.

What sort of world would it be even if we "won" a nuclear war? The military
expenditure costs and the human costs would not be worth the world that 
remained. Wald says, "there is nothing worth having that can be obtained by nuclear war." 
We may ask ourselves presently whether our War on Terror is giving us
a world we want to live in. Do we want secret armies that report only to the
President? Do we want a President who is so preoccupied with plans to kill and
with being killed? 

Wald, remarking on the bind of mutual assured destruction (MAD!!!) 
that the Cold War presented us, noted that "a balance of terror is still 
terror!" Us Americans are presented with a foe who is both foreign and domestic,
ecstatic in their devotion to God which is synonomous with their devotion to 
destroying us infidels. Our counter-terrorism is the secret army with secret
missions. Our terror inpires fear that even if you've declared yourself on our
side, at any point American mercenaries may shoot up your market or the world's
most technologically advanced and best trained killers mistake your house for
a military compound, or the dark-magic drones controlled by afar that 
constantly buzz overhead select you and your familiy for elimination, or that
you are part of the latest nakbah, forced to leave your destroyed home for a
prison camp because Jewish settlers have kicked you out and there is no 
justice system in the world that could begin to remedy the situation.

So, we have to ask ourselves again, is this the world we want to live in? As
Black Thought, The Roots' MC, says, "If you ain't sayin nothin you the system's accomplice."
If we want to overcome, we must take Jesus's advice and make God our master.
The failure of Atheism is its inability to deliver us from the chains of 
Capital. And it is precisely these chains that keep the secret armies of and 
police forces in the United States active and unquestioned.

# Buying up of everything

It is only a select few Americans who know exactly what technology is in the
pipeline. Fewer still know the full extent of military operations underway
by American forces. The political explanations are obvious and difficult to
question, and go something like, "If we tell you we'd have to kill you because
you don't need to know and if what you know gets leaked, we will be putting 
American lives at risk." The political mechanisms for enshrining the 
infallibility of such statements are the focus of this section. Because if we 
can see the mechanisms of power we uncover that this crisis of terrorism that
necessitates all the allowances we grant the government and army is 
immensely profitable in terms of money and power for a select few.

Wald is primarily concerned with the co-opting of science and scientists, whom
Wald says their business is of life. I am also concerned, having been developing
missile technology, which I unknowingly stumbled into doing. During graduate
school, certain talented professors would return from Washington meetings with
Defense Department officials, unable to speak of what they were doing. Wald
says about his generation of science that every branch of science had a 
Washington office. The DoD comes around with loads of money and buys the 
scientific society representatives a good time with a business meeting as well. 
In Wald's time, this meant he was invited to "leaf abscission" and 
"genetic transferrence" conferences which were code names for burning trees and
crops in Vietnam and biowarfare. In our time, that means that graduate students
like me, weaned on stories of Einstein, many of us poets as much as scientists,
and suddenly I'm giving a demo to three guys from the CIA for my adviser's 
company and a demo to a Lockheed Martin mathematician who tells me, "Lockheed
needs to show we can put this on the front of a missle!"

# Our cosmic responsibility

Wald's argument aligns with Jesus': we are the protectors of life in our 
corner of the universe. We can't let the naysayers get us down. When they say
things like war is a fact of life, that our enemies are constantly plotting
against us because they hate our freedom. We need to analyze the roots of the
hatred, the ongoing imperialism that continues to this day. We need to recognize
our own role in this killer super-organism. Once we've recognized it and 
understood it, we can grow into our responsibility as stewards of life. 

I started this post feeling hopeful, and I end it feeling content: Even though
there is impossible evil that we are up against, we must remain strong and 
sure that there is another way, a middle road, where the imposition of the 
false dichotomy of either being killed by terrorists or don't question, allow the 
institution of a permanent, secret state of war along with secret, militarized
police forces. There is another choice. It isn't easy to follow or stick to 
because the lure of money and the demands of capital is intense, and we 
truly can't live without money these days. 

Nonetheless, our choice is simple: choose life or choose death.
