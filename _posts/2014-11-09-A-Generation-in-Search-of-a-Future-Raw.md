# George Wald and his Critical Protest Speech

George Wald was a Harvard Professor who won the Nobel Prize for his work on 
human color vision. During a period of class shutdowns, teach-ins, and other
protests. He is disillusioned by the infection that is claiming everything from
labor unions to science itself.

My next posts will be devoted to analyzing this speech and my process for making
it. For now, I want to provide the first and second sides of the speech. This
is inspiration for me to tell my tale that supports Wald's thesis and expand 
his message with [government contract data](https://github.com/mtpain/contracts). 

This is the George Wald Speech "A Generation in Search of a Future" given March 
4, 1969. He responds to the climate where Harvard poly sci professors are saying
that there is a 50-50 chance that a nuclear holocaust *happens* between that date
and the year 2000. I am convinced the parallels are striking and often obvious.

## Key quote:

> A balance of terror is still terror and we can't live in a balance of terror!

To be fair this is in reference to atomic weapons. But now the opposing terrors
are that we will be bombed in our homes, attacked at school, and so forth, 
versus the kind of terror where the best killers in the world might enter the 
wrong home or invade your town, and be completely unaccountable for their 
actions.
