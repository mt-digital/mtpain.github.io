## recent history and aspirations
In the past two years, I moved from Houston, TX, where I finished a master's in
applied physics to Moscow, Idaho, where I currently work as a data engineer. 
In my spare time I read, cook, work in the garden, study the bible and its teachings
alone or with friends
and fellows, play guitar, code, or bike, among other things. 

Very recently, I became the volunteer coordinator of my church
to organize our efforts towards the Family Promise of the Palouse program. 
Family Promise is an organization dedicated to helping homeless families, 
started when a New Jersey professional realized that, maybe more than a 
handout of food or cash, the homeless seek dignity. 

I love programming, so I love my job right now. But I'm also interested in 
journalism.  Back when I switched from journalism to physics and mathematics
as a major in college, I always told myself that I could come back. At least
in my spare time, I hope that will be the case. Currently in my sights is a 
project on federal research spending, and the pipeline from government spending
in the academies to military, pharmaceutical, food, and other products whose sales
often are by the government and from which private
corporations profit immensely from. The motivation for this is given below, the
last bit of my 'further back history'.

## further back history
### youth in Western New York State
I was born in Rochester, NY, on a cold March evenening. In high school I played
baseball and some other sports, biked much, had a band named BWAH, and got into 
not very much trouble. I originally enrolled
in Syracuse University as an undecided communications major because I loved writing
and the worlds of literature. But, the allure of quantum mechanics and strange,
mysterious, yet knowable, mathematical symbols was too much, and I switched 
to a double major in physics and mathematics in my second year. During those 
undergrad years I worked on cosmology, computational electrodynamics, and 
gravitational wave astronomy.

### grad school at Rice (Houston, TX)
In grad school I decided I wanted to diversify
my talents and ended up building microscopes and cameras based on the 
"single-pixel camera." 
During that time I had a grand period of disillusionment, partly based on my 
own meandering mind that discovered Chomsky and songwriting for our band
called Sunday Afternoon. Playing music was the most fun thing I had going, 
and I still hadn't shaken the dream of being a profiessional musician.  
In the grad school years, I found my work co-opted by my adviser's startup
(maybe taken as a normal thing these days), I gave a product demo of our camera
to the CIA's venture captial arm, In-Q-Tel, and had a mathematician working for
Lockheed Martin tell us (me and my two Chinese national labmates) that 
Lockheed needs to know that we can put this on the front of a missile. So, on
Tuesday I'd carry a sign, or protest "Energy Day" in downtown Houston with 
Occupy Houston protesters, and on Wednesday I'd be developing technology that
would rain hell on Arabs or whoever else chose to defy the United States. 

### paradigm shift
Perhaps what stunned me most about it all was the absence of discussion of 
issues of ethics. Of course there are "ethics" courses in the sciences, but,
as far as I know, these are courses that say "don't fake your data" and 
"don't steal other people's data" and to what degree one can remove 
outliers and still get published in _Nature_. It's not anything like, "Taxpayers
pay for this research and then it's used as weaponry in wars that, according to
some, are outright illegal, if we even know about them."  And on the
day Anwar Al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was killed by a drone strike without
trial, my research adviser defended the killing; my adviser claimed he had reviewed all
the evidence, and the case for the death penalty without trial was clear: 
the man killed had 'declared war' on the United States. Or maybe it is just 
bad business practice to bite the hand that feeds you.

So, my initial reaction was to protest. This served much the same purpose that
I feel the Occupy protests served: a voice to an inner conflict, a battle cry
against a feeling of helplessness and powerlessness. I read Bird and Sherwin's
biography of Oppenheimer, and realized the nuclear age had ushered in with it
a behemoth of a problem that is the military industrial complex. After moving to
Idaho, I discovered an old vinyl recording in the UI Library of Nobel Laureate George Wald
lecturing in support of a walkout by Boston-area faculty in protest of the 
Vietnam war, whose napalm and defoliation campaign with the now-infamous
Agent Orange was created in concert with University laboratories. Reading Chomsky's 
"The responsibility of intellectuals" taught me that it takes the village of the
academies to endorse mass slaughter and make it seem reasonable, even justified,
even a science for curious young minds to develop and employ. Where starvation
of the Vietnamese non-combatant populace is like a set of optics mirrors in my
laboratory, and the people are the sample, the political scientists of the time
using the laboratory of Vietnam for evil experiments done at a plane ride's 
distance from an armchair, disfugring generations to
come; and now any thoughtful academic's face is disfigured with guilt. Of course
there was no such thing as noncombatant then in Vietnam--any who wasn't clearly
a capitalist in the city was a filthy commie sympathizer and the rot must be 
cut out. Just as now, the terrorists are everyone who is not 'with us.'
